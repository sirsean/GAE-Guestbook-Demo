This is my take on Appengine's demo Guestbook application. It uses Spring 3 and Maven.

To build:

    mvn clean install

To start the server:

    ant runserver

Note the AppConfig class, which has the @Configuration annotation; this replaces Google's PMF class and gets rid of the static PersistenceManagerFactory, using dependency injection instead.

Also, I've created some base classes for the DAOs, in the com.vikinghammer.dao package. This simplifies the creation of new DAO classes.
